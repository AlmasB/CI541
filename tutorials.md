#### Tutorial 1

Note: take breaks at regular intervals between tasks.

The assignment is to build a 3rd person game with genre of your choosing (e.g. action, puzzle, platformer, etc.). This tutorial will help you shape your ideas.

1. Read the assignment brief.
1. Note down important points and requirements. Do you _precisely_ what you need to do?
1. Read the assignment brief again. Compare to your notes. Check if you missed anything.
1. Think about your game that you will develop. 
1. Background research (see what you can find online about existing games similar to what you want to do).
1. Create a Word (or alternative) document.
1. Add a page with a few sentences related to your game vision idea and how it might be implemented. No need for details yet, just think about what objects you will need in the game, e.g. player, coin, enemy, etc.
1. By the end of this tutorial, ensure you have at least a vague (ideally, solid) idea of what game you will build.
